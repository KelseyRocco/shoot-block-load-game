# **How To Play Load, Block, Shoot**
You have three options to choose from:
<br><br>
**Load** - loads your gun  
**Block** - blocks shots at you 
**Shoot** - shoots your opponent  
<br><br>

To win the game, you must shoot your opponent first.  
You can only shoot your opponent _after_ you've loaded your gun.  
If your bullet count is zero, you have nothing to shoot!  
In order for you to successfully shoot your oppenent,    
they must be loading their gun at the time you shoot.

If you choose **load** and they shoot, you've lost!  
If they choose **block**, that will block your bullet.   
If they choose **shoot** as well, the two shots cancel eachother out.  

## GOOD LUCK!
