# How To Play Load, Block, Shoot
You have three options to choose from:
<br><br>
**Load** - loads your gun  
**Shoot** - shoots your opponent  
**Block** - blocks shots at you 
<br><br>

To win the game, you must shoot your opponent first.  
You can only shoot your opponent _after_ you've loaded your gun.  
If your bullet count is zero, you have nothing to shoot!  
In order for you to successfully shoot your oppenent,    
they must be loading their gun at the time you shoot.  
If they choose **block**, that will block your bullet.   
If they choose **shoot** as well, the two shots cancel eachother out.

## GOOD LUCK!

## Next Steps
- have different sounds play depending on choice
- have computer gun face opponent
- make CSS more attractive
- add a timer so that user has to make a decision within 2secs, otherwise, will choose "reload" automatically (most vulnerable choice) as consequence
